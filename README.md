# Interflow API

## This is the API that is responsible for all user actions.

Our native application communicates directly with this API. From there, we perform actions and send requests to the [Interflow Wallet API](https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow-api) when needed.

This server is a TypeScript/NodeJS application that you need the following to run locally

install npm

run npm dev

We leave the .env files open to make testing easier!

*This app is live

[**To test all Interflow features quickly and easily, follow the instructions in the Interflow repository**](https://github.com/interflowrepo/interflow/blob/main/README.md)
